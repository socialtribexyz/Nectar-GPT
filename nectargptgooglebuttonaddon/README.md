# Google nectarGPT

A Google Chrome extension that swaps the `I'm Feeling Lucky` button for a nectarGPT button 🤖

No api key required as it redirects to `https://chat.openai.com/chat` and auto submits the prompt ⚡️

If you are looking to make your own extension or have a go modifying this one. I have commented all the code to make it nice and easy to understand / navigate 😁

## Features

- Removes the _"I'm Feeling Lucky"_ button 🚮
- Use /c in your searches to turn them into a prompt for ChatGPT 🤖
- You can also use the new shiny `NectarGPT` button ✨

## How to install

1. go to: `chrome://extensions/` in your browser
2. Turn on developer mode in the top right-hand side
3. Click on `Load unpacked` in the top left-hand side
4. Select the folder with the extensions code
5. Now you can use chatgpt from the google homepage 😎
